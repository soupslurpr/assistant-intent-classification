# assistant-intent-classification

This is my attempt at training a model to categorize different categories of assistant intents, like "Set a timer for 5 minutes" to "timer", or "Remind me to walk the dog at 5 pm" to "reminder", and more.

Unformatted training data is found at the raw_data folder, a Rust program formats it to training.txt (located in formatted_data folder).

Contributions to the training data are needed if you can help :), but please note this is mostly an experiment and I am very much a beginner to machine learning.
